tl;dr
1. SCA (b) is a lightweight augmentation of SAM (a) with the ability to generate regional captions.
2. On top of SAM architecture, we add a fixed pre-trained language mode, and a optimizable lightweight hybrid feature mixture whose training is cheap and scalable.
3. Despite the absence of semantic labels in the training data, SAM implies high-level semantics sufficient for captioning.
